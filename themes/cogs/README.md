# cogs

The theme for my website

## Requirements

Requires an installation of `postcss-cli` in the root project folder to work, as this uses
[PostCSS](https://postcss.org) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

Also requires a `prepare` script, like so:

```json
{
	"prepare": "cd themes/cogs && npm i "
}
```
