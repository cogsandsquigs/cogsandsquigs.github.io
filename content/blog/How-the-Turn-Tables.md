So...

It's been a bit, hasn't it?

Finished both my jobs, have been working on projects and such, etc. etc. you know the drill. However, remember the post I made about [US college applications](@/blog/surviving-early-action/)? Well, you probably inferred that I was applying to college as well. Naturally, 75% of the colleges rejected me. Lmao.

But what you probably don't know is that I *also* applied internationally. Yes, thats right! I applied to 2 international schools: Oxford and Imperial College London (henceforth referred to as "Imperial" or "ICL"). The application process is much simpler than the process in the US: Write your personal statement (Not an essay about your "growth" or other bullshit, just why you want to go to college and what makes you a good candidate), fill out background information (birthdate, residence, etc. etc.), and take any tests or interviews required. For Oxford, that was the [MAT](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/study-here/undergraduate-study/maths-admissions-test) in November. For Imperial, it was a simple pre-test, then interview, then the [STEP 2](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/undergrad/admissions/step) in *June*. Also, they may require your senior-year AP/IB scores as well, which Imperial did for me (I was rejected from oxford :( oh well). However, Imperial is changing the pre-test and STEP 2 to be consolidated into the [TMUA](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/apply/undergraduate/process/admissions-tests/tmua/), which is in October.

ANYWAYS, in January of this year I got back a notification from imperial: I had a *conditional* offer! If I got all 5s on my APs and reached 2 in STEP 2, I could make it in! Suffice to say, I infact got in.

However, it's not as simple as just getting in and going: Remember, I also applied to *US* colleges, and I "officially" decided on UMaryland. I didn't know about Imperial until
