I never promised to provide consistent updates to this blog, and here is that un-promise in action. It's not that I hate this blog; on the contrary, I find it one of the more prideful points of this site. However, I can't provide consistent updates because I have many things going on right now, and most likely will until next year or slightly before. Between college apps and finals, projects and part-time jobs, I've got a lot on my plate. So here's my (attempted) explainer for what I've been doing.

## College Apps

I finished submitting my [regular-decision](@/blog/Surviving-Early-Action.md) college applications. You may wonder if I was doing this because I was lazy and pushed them back (like I hinted at in the previous post), but in reality, it's a bit more complicated. See, I was waiting for test results from a math competition to come back. Because they didn't come back until mid-December, I was stuck waiting until close to the due dates (early January) to submit my apps. And when I went to submit them, it turned out that there were a few sections that I missed when filling out my applications. I had to complete those ASAP, and that took a while.

## Finals week

Finals week came and went at my school, and while it wasn't too bad, it could have been better. I spent more time focusing on studying for finals --- which as everyone knows, is no fun. Fortunately, I passed with A's on all my finals, and I no longer have to worry about last semester :3.

## Projects!

I've been working on a few projects here and there, which you may see on this website! I finally added links to the repositories hosting the projects on the [projects page]().
