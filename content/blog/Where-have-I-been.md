I never promised to provide consistent updates to this blog, and here is that un-promise in action. It's not that I hate this blog; on the contrary, I find it one of the more prideful points of this site. However, I can't provide consistent updates because I have many things going on right now, and most likely will until next year or slightly before. Between college apps and finals, projects and part-time jobs, I've got a lot on my plate. So here's my (attempted) explainer for what I've been doing.

## College Apps

I finished submitting my [regular-decision](@/blog/Surviving-Early-Action.md) college applications. You may wonder if I was doing this because I was lazy and pushed them back (like I hinted at in the previous post), but in reality, it's a bit more complicated. See, I was waiting for test results from a math competition to come back. Because they didn't come back until mid-December, I was stuck waiting until close to the due dates (early January) to submit my apps. And when I went to submit them, it turned out that there were a few sections that I missed when filling out my applications. I had to complete those ASAP, and that took a while.

## Finals week

Finals week came and went at my school, and while it wasn't too bad, it could have been better. I spent more time focusing on studying for finals --- which as everyone knows, is no fun. Fortunately, I passed with A's on all my finals, and I no longer have to worry about last semester :3.

## Projects!

I've been working on a few projects here and there, which you may see on this website! I finally added links to the repositories hosting the projects on the [projects page](/projects) as well as other (mostly invisible) issues that have been bugging me for a bit. Besides private projects, the biggest endeavor was releasing new versions of [dotbak](@/projects/Dotbak.md). As of writing, the latest release is v0.3.2, which includes major UI improvements, synchronization fixes, refactors, and more! Go check it out on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/dotbak) or install it with cargo install dotbak.

## Part-time Job

I've landed myself a part-time job recently, which is awesome: now I have more money to spend on \~\~apple hardware\~\~ \~\~snacks :3\~\~ responsible things an adult would spend on. However, this will take up a lot of my free time, which means slower (if you can even imagine) progress on development and posts. Therefore, don't expect anything big until I either get a college update (!!) or have a major change.

## Being a capital-G Gamer

I played playing Portal and Portal 2 for the first time in December, and it was really fun. I liked the puzzle-platformer-style challenges reminiscent of other platformers like Celeste as well as the very smooth graphics that a decades-old game on modern hardware offers. I know it's crazy that I haven't played it yet, but that's who I am. I've also started [Portal Revolution](https://store.steampowered.com/app/601360/Portal_Revolution/), a free-to-play mod that's really, really good and bridges the gap between Portal and Portal 2 in terms of story. I'm looking forward to playing it in the future.

Overall, I'm mostly satisfied with the state of my life so far, and I'm hoping that this post explains why I haven't posted about Advent of Code this year, like even at all (don't worry, I did it, it was fun). Now if you'll excuse me, I have some business (see the above) to attend to.
