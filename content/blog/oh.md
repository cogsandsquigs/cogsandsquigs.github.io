So. That just happened.

I'm writing here just to collect my thoughts, and also to tell anyone reading this that I am OK.

I've been very very lucky recently.

I somehow got into Imperial College London, which was

1. A moonshot for me, and 
2. Very lucky for me considering the outcome of the 2024 general election

I was planning on posting about this sometime before now, but coursework caught up with me, and it's kinda too late now.

I'm worried immensely about my future, about where I go from here. I have plans to stay abroad for the next 4 years, and I'm possibly thinking about getting citizenship in the UK. As a queer citizen of the USA, it scares me that my whole entire life could just be turned upside down if I stayed.

Even my state was shifting more red. In terms of differences between democrat and republican electoral results, we're getting into the single digits now. I'm scared that republicans could take over and flip the state red, which means that my family will have little other places to go. Maybe the east coast? We do have family friends over there...

But we also would leave behind our community. Our friends so close that they're basically family ("framily", as my mom likes to call it). We'd lose the neighborhood block parties, we'd lose the christmas party my mom puts on every year for all of us and our friends.

In the most morbid sense, I'm reluctantly glad my family is white. We won't be the prime target of this campaign. But given we're all pretty left-leaning, I'm scared that Trump could come for us ["crazy marxists"](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-enemies-from-within-5c4a34776469a55e71d3ba4d4e68cf62). 

I'll stay in the UK for the next 4-5 years, maybe more. I have university to attend, and a (hopefully present) future to carve out for myself. I'm safe for now, but I still need to watch out --- the UK has been leaning more conservative as well.

I'm so tired of this. When will we ever be safe? When will we not be afraid to be radical --- our independent women, our strong trans siblings, our brave people of color, our toiling working class --- when will we realize that we can stand together as one country, and fight for all of us? When will we learn that the enemy is not each other, but those who want to divide us?

When will we learn to be whole again?
