Hi! This is my testing page. What does that mean? well, it means this is where all my website features are tested.

## Post format

At the top, you should see something like “Hello World! Created/Posted on {date}”.

## Code block styling

Below, you should see a code block of typescript, colored in correctly.

```ts
let x: string = "hello world!";
const test = () => {
    console.log(x);
};

test();
```

## Math and $\LaTeX$

Below, you should see some $\LaTeX$ being formatted correctly and displayed correctly as math equations. You should be seeing the _Riemann Zeta function_, $\zeta(s)$, as well as its definition!

$$
{\displaystyle \zeta (s)=\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{n^{s}}}={\frac {1}{1^{s}}}+{\frac {1}{2^{s}}}+{\frac {1}{3^{s}}}+\cdots}
$$
