Heyo!

Sorry for being extra sporadic with my advent of code posts. Between home and school life, as well as a general lack of motivation and dealing with shit, I haven't had much time. However, I thought you guys (the .04 people reading this) deserved an update.

So, will I post the solution for this? Probably not. The code is _really_ messy and ugly and I don't want to go through it a second time, even though it would probably benefit me as a programmer. I'll most likely post a solution here for day 8, 9, 10 or 11 in the future (depending on how much work I have). 

And as for all other things, I'm doing pretty well for myself. School is going well, things are getting done (although I'm stalling on some personal projects at the moment), etc. etc.

I don't really have anything else to say right now, so goodbye for now :3
