So, you may wonder.

"Ian, how did you come up with the username `cogsandsquigs`?"

Well, dear reader, let me take you on a journey. One that involves
artificial intelligence, a suprising amount of laziness on my part,
and most importantly, having fun. All for the low, low price of
$0.00.

Flash back to a boring weekend. I was bored, and I got sick of my
current username. However, I didn't want to just _think_ of a new
username. After all, I was not just bored, but _lazy_. I didn't want
to make a new username which I'd get bored with because it was too
boring. And I'm a programmer after all. I should be able to automate
this!

And then, I remembered: GPT-3 exists! I could use that to
auto-generate some new usernames from existing examples I could pull
from my friends and myself!

I quicky ran to [OpenAI's GPT-3 API page](https://openai.com/api),
and to my dismay, there I saw it. The formidable, awful, horrendous...

_pricing tab_.

I didn't want to pay for this! I have a streak of ~~abusing~~ using
free services, and I didn't want to pay a fraction of a cent for the
measly task of simply _generating new usernames_. Who am I, a common
consumer?

No, I decided to instead scour the web for other ways.

And then I found it.

GPT-J-6b.

GPT-J-6b is a creation by [Eluther.ai](https://eluther.ai). It was
designed to be a parallel to GPT-2, and more importantly, a stepping
stone on the road to matching OpenAI's language models, and even
perhaps, exceeding them, for AI and language model research.

More importantly, GPT-J-6b has a
[free online public demo](https://6b.eluther.ai). One that I could use
to ~~exploit for my own purposes~~ create usernames because I was
lazy and bored.

So how did I do this?

Well, it was simple! I simply input a prompt which described what I wanted,
and then voila! I let it run.

```
Prompt:
Online usernames:
1. piuququip
2. Floofray
3. Axsphyrix
4. batma
5. dizzybipper
6.

Output:
Online usernames:
1. piuququip
2. Floofray
3. Axsphyrix
4. batma
5. dizzybipper
6. ktaro
7. Mr.Omega
8. Mx2
9. chocoholic
10. rompree
11. E-v-o
12. chubas
13. alexa
14. budmo
15. 8ball
16. Ms.Tsu
17. mysterion
18. c_m_i
19. balldave
20. a_m_i
21. kevs
22. Ktaro
23. p-i-u-q-u-q-i-p
24. flof
```

And there you go! Free, easy, on-demand usernames, ready to be
used online. And they are all (most likely) unique!

Now, sometimes you'll get a lot of repeating usernames or repeating
patterns. To solve this, I recommend turning the temperature up
to 1.0 or over (The temperature is roughly the "uniqueness" or
"randomness" variable, and tells the AI roughly how much "risk"
it's allowed to take in generating a response).

Fun fact! While GPT-2 has 1.5 billion parameters, GPT-J-6b has,
you guessed it, 6 billion parameters! That's quite a lot, and [it
shows](https://github.com/kingoflolz/mesh-transformer-jax/#zero-shot-evaluations)
because it's pretty ok at completing prompts (or at least
this one).

That's all for now!

Bye!
