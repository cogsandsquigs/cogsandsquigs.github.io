Hi! This is my testing page. What does that mean? well,
it means this is where all my website features are tested.

Here's a table of contents to help you traverse this page!

## Table of Contents

## Post format
At the top, you should see something like "Hello World!
Created at {date}".

## Code block styling
Below, you should see a code block of typescript, colored
in correctly.

```ts
let x: string = "hello world!";

const test = () => {
    console.log(x);
};

test();
```
## Github-flavored markdown
### Footnotes
This is a footnote![^1]
[^1]: Wow! more quality content!

## Math and MathJax
Below, you should see some MathJax being formatted correctly
and displayed correctly as math equations. You should be
seeing the _Riemann Zeta function_, $\zeta(s)$, as well as
its definition!

$$
{\displaystyle \zeta (s)=\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{n^{s}}}={\frac {1}{1^{s}}}+{\frac {1}{2^{s}}}+{\frac {1}{3^{s}}}+\cdots}
$$
