Hi! This is my testing page. What does that mean? well,
it means this is where all my website features are tested.

At the top, you should see something like "Hello World! 
Posted on whatever date". Below, you should see a code
block of javascript, colored in correctly.

```javascript
let x = "hello world!";
function test() {
  console.log(x);
}

test();
```

Below, you should see some KaTeX being formatted correctly
and displayed correctly as math equations!

$\KaTeX$
$f(x) = x^2$
