    Hey! I'm Ian Pratt, although I go by the online alias <u>cogsandsquigs</u>.
    I program things for fun and profit (although mainly for fun!). Currently,
    my main project is working on my website, and making it look as brilliant
    and fancy as possible :3. It's also a great way to practice my
    <a href="/blog/tags/webdev">webdev</a> skills!
</p>

<p>
    It may be obvious at this point, but I built this whole site from scratch! I
    really like programming things (especially things I can see!), and I plan to
    have a job in computer science in the future!
</p>

<p>
    And of course, I'm <em>fabulously</em> gay. Don't worry though, I don't bite!
    (at least, in most cases I don't).
</p>

<p>
    Check out the rest of my site for more stuff I'm doing! Or, if it's your
    thing, take a look at my <a href="https://github.com/cogsandsquigs"
        >Github page</a
    > if you're into looking at someone else's code.
</p>

<p>
    (P.S.: If you're <em>really</em> into my blog, you might be happy to know
    that it has an <a href="/rss.xml">RSS feed</a>! Enjoy live updates of my
    blog every 1-2 millenia.)
</p>
