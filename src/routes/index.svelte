  Welcome to my website!!!
</h1>

<p>
  I'm glad you could make it! This is my little corner of the web, made with
  <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev">SvelteKit</a>,
  <a href="https://tailwindcss.com">Tailwind CSS</a>, and
  <a href="https://mdsvex.com">mdsvex</a>. This website is also deployed on
  <a href="https://vercel.com">Vercel</a>! In any case, I hope you enjoy what
  you find here! Why not check out my
  <a href="blog/hello-world">testing page</a>? It's where I test out new things
  for my website, and generally just mess around!
</p>
<p>
  If you want to know more about me, go to my <a href="/about">about me page</a
  >! Or, you could go explore the rest of my website. IDK, its up to you! After
  all, I'm not paying you a fortune to look at my site ;).
</p>

<p>Have fun, and stay snazzy!</p>
