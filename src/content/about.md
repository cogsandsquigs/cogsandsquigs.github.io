Hey! I'm Ian Pratt, although I go by the online alias <u>**cogsandsquigs**</u>. I program things for fun and profit (although mainly for fun!). Currently, my main project is working on my website, and making it look as brilliant and fancy as possible. It's also a great way to practice my [webdev](/tags/webdev) skills!

It may be obvious at this point, but I built this whole site from scratch! I really like programming things (especially things I can see!), and I plan to have a job in computer science in the future!

Check out the rest of my site for more stuff I'm doing! Or, if it's your thing, take a look at my Github page if you're into looking at someone else's code.

(P.S.: If you're really into my blog n projects n stuff, you might be happy to know that it has an [RSS feed](/rss.xml)! Enjoy live updates of my blog every 1-2 millenia.)
