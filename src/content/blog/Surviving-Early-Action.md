So... Where have I been?

For those who don't know, the Early Action/Early Decision (EA/ED) deadline just passed a few days ago (4, at the time of writing). This means that any and all schools who have deadlines for EA/ED application pools have just closed, and you can't apply to them in the EA/ED pools anymore. It was a *lot* of work to get here, and I had to figure a lot of things out for myself with not a lot of guidance, at least for some less-heard-of things.

But what even is EA/ED? What's the difference? Why does it matter? How should you start? Well, here's a quick rundown for any underclassmen and/or international students looking to go to college (and/or university, same difference here) in the USA, because I've been through this hell and you are gonna need to suffer too (sorry :/):

## Making a list and checking it twice (thrice, qurice?)
The first thing you should do in your sophomore and/or junior year of high school (or 10th/11th grade in whatever secondary education you have) is making a college list. This is *the* most important thing you should be doing, right up there with studying for the SAT/ACT (which you should've definitely heard of by now). Knowing what schools you'll be applying to will make this entire process smoother, because then you'll be able to organize your work around the deadlines for each (and believe me, they all have different ones for every little thing). Make a list of about 10-15 that you want to go to, and make sure you *want* to go there: in some cases, there's no backing out [^1]. Once that's done, you can start on working towards your second goal, the *personal essay*.

## Spilling the beans (or tea, or hot goss, or...)
The next most important thing is to start working on your *personal essay*. See, most colleges[^2] use an application platform called [CommonApp](https://www.commonapp.org/), which requires a personal essay. This essay is then used by most[^3] colleges to help aid in evaluating your application, because it will (should) give a good overview of who you are as a person and who you've come to be. For my application year (2023-2024), there were 7 different prompts that I could chose from (not all 7!) to write my essay about. They were, as follows:
> 1.  Some students have a background, identity, interest, or talent that is so meaningful they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story.
> 2.  The lessons we take from obstacles we encounter can be fundamental to later success. Recount a time when you faced a challenge, setback, or failure. How did it affect you, and what did you learn from the experience?
> 3.  Reflect on a time when you questioned or challenged a belief or idea. What prompted your thinking? What was the outcome?
> 4.  Reflect on something that someone has done for you that has made you happy or thankful in a surprising way. How has this gratitude affected or motivated you?
> 5.  Discuss an accomplishment, event, or realization that sparked a period of personal growth and a new understanding of yourself or others.
> 6.  Describe a topic, idea, or concept you find so engaging that it makes you lose all track of time. Why does it captivate you? What or who do you turn to when you want to learn more?
> 7.  Share an essay on any topic of your choice. It can be one you've already written, one that responds to a different prompt, or one of your own design.

the important thing to get right about writing your essay is that you want to demonstrate parts of your character that you can't put anywhere else on your applications. Most applications will ask for awards, club activities, et cetera, but your personal essay is where you can shine by showing a part of you that isn't easily shown on paper. 

[^1]: Early Decision is *binding* for most (if not all) schools.
[^2]: See: [MIT's application](https://apply.mitadmissions.org/apply), the [UC Colleges Application](https://apply.universityofcalifornia.edu), et cetera.
[^3]: Again, see [MIT's essay questions](https://mitadmissions.org/apply/firstyear/essays-activities-academics/), the [UC Colleges Personal Insight questions](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/how-to-apply/applying-as-a-freshman/personal-insight-questions.html), et cetera. For some reason, the University of Washington doesn't require an essay in the Writing section of the CommonApp, but *does* require it in its own supplemental sections? Whatever.
