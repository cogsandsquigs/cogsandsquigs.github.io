So... where have I been?

For those who don't know, the Early Action/Early Decision (EA/ED) deadline just passed a few days ago (4, at the time of writing). This means that any and all schools who have deadlines for EA/ED application pools have just closed, and you can't apply to them in the EA/ED pools anymore. It was a *lot* of work to get here, and I had to figure a lot of things out for myself with not a lot of guidance, at least for some less-heard-of things.

But what even is EA/ED? What's the difference? Why does it matter? How should you start? Well, here's a quick rundown for any underclassmen and/or international students looking to go to college (and/or university, same difference here) in the USA, because I've been through this hell and you are gonna need to suffer too (sorry :/):

## Making a list and checking it twice (thrice, qurice?)
The first thing you should do in your sophomore and/or junior year of high school (or 10th/11th grade in whatever secondary education you have) is making a college list. This is *the* most important thing you should be doing, right up there with studying for the SAT/ACT (which you should've definitely heard of by now). Knowing what schools you'll be applying to will make this entire process smoother, because then you'll be able to organize your work around the deadlines for each (and believe me, they all have different ones for every little thing). Make a list of about 10-15 that you want to go to, and make sure you *want* to go there: in some cases, there's no backing out [^1]. Once that's done, you can start on working towards your second goal, the *personal essay*.

The most important choice to make right now is whether to apply EA, REA, ED, RD/RA, or whatever the fuck else colleges come up with. Here's a quick rundown:
- **EA**: Stands for early action, it's the application pool due November 1st. Why have sooner deadlines? Because the application pool is smaller, so you have a better chance of getting in. It also shows colleges that you really want to go there, although REA/ED is a better way of showing that. This application is *non-restrictive*, meaning you can apply EA to as many schools as you want.
- **ED**: Early decision. The most notable difference is that this is *binding*, meaning you 1) can't apply to any other schools but one with ED, and 

## Spilling the beans (or tea, or hot goss, or...)
The next most important thing is to start working on your *personal essay*. See, most colleges[^2] use an application platform called [CommonApp](https://www.commonapp.org/), which requires a personal essay. This essay is then used by most[^3] colleges to help aid in evaluating your application, because it will (should) give a good overview of who you are as a person and who you've come to be. For my application year (2023-2024), there were 7 different prompts that I could chose from (not all 7!) to write my essay about. They were, as follows:
> 1.  Some students have a background, identity, interest, or talent that is so meaningful they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story.
> 2.  The lessons we take from obstacles we encounter can be fundamental to later success. Recount a time when you faced a challenge, setback, or failure. How did it affect you, and what did you learn from the experience?
> 3.  Reflect on a time when you questioned or challenged a belief or idea. What prompted your thinking? What was the outcome?
> 4.  Reflect on something that someone has done for you that has made you happy or thankful in a surprising way. How has this gratitude affected or motivated you?
> 5.  Discuss an accomplishment, event, or realization that sparked a period of personal growth and a new understanding of yourself or others.
> 6.  Describe a topic, idea, or concept you find so engaging that it makes you lose all track of time. Why does it captivate you? What or who do you turn to when you want to learn more?
> 7.  Share an essay on any topic of your choice. It can be one you've already written, one that responds to a different prompt, or one of your own design.

The important thing to get right about writing your essay is that you want to demonstrate parts of your character that you can't put anywhere else on your applications. Most applications will ask for awards, club activities, et cetera, but your personal essay is where you can shine by showing a part of you that isn't easily shown on paper. The advice I've heard (and what I've written about) is to write about a time, event, place, idea, or something that shows that you've grown as a person. Whether a difficult class, an ugly relationship, or whatever.
> Note: DON'T make yourself seem pitiful! Admissions officers don't have time for that and don't want that. Instead, focus the main part of the essay on how you've *grown* as a person from that experience, and how it benefits you to this day (ideally, how it will benefit you in college too).

You should start writing this essay near or on the end of Junior year (11th grade), so that you can (hopefully) finish it by late August or early September. Remember to write many drafts!

### Side note: Having a second pair of eyes
It's *really* nice to have someone else there to look over your essay. Not write it for you, of course (you'll have to do that yourself), but just be there to help make sure that you're going in the right direction and making all the right writing choices. Choose someone who's gone through this process before, because they can also help you with the general process too!

## CommonApp-ing
By now, it's early September. EA deadlines are at early November, so you need to hurry. Now's the time to start filling out the CommonApp (or any other college application forms). Generally, they'll list a series of sections asking about you, your family, your grades, activities, awards, and anything else any college would need. Make sure you have everything you'll need to report the best self you were in the past 4 years.

However, there's another section of the CommonApp, one that has to be done *per school*. these are the *supplemental essay questions* ("supplementals" for short), and most schools ask at least one. Usually, they're pretty tame, like "Why do you want to go to \<insert university\>" or "How would your friends describe you"[^4]. You'd probably want the same person looking over your personal essay to look over your supplementals, too, just to make sure you're not doing anything silly there.

Once all of that's done, each school usually requires a \$75-\$80 fee to send in a single application, and that fee is *per-school*. 10 schools would cost \$750-\$800, while 20 would cost over 1000! (and that's not even accounting for the CSS Profile!)

There really isn't much else to say here, just make sure you present yourself in the best light possible and include as many activities as you can possibly include. 

## But Wait! There's More!
Wohoo! It's November 2nd, and you've submittied all of your EA/ED applications

For some reason, the University of Washington doesn't require an essay in the Writing section of the CommonApp, but *does* require it in its own supplemental sections? Whatever.
