So... Where have I been?

For those who don't know, the Early Action/Early Decision (EA/ED) deadline just passed a few days ago (4, at the time of writing). This means that any and all schools who have deadlines for EA/ED application pools have just closed, and you can't apply to them in the EA/ED pools anymore. It was a *lot* of work to get here, and I had to figure a lot of things out for myself with not a lot of guidance, at least for some less-heard-of things.

But what even is EA/ED? What's the difference? Why does it matter? How should you start? Well, here's a quick rundown for any underclassmen and/or international students looking to go to college (and/or university, same difference here) in the USA, because I've been through this hell and you are gonna need to suffer too (sorry :/):

## Making a list and checking it twice (thrice, qurice?)
The first thing you should do in your sophomore and/or junior year of high school (or 10th/11th grade in whatever secondary education you have) is making a college list. This is *the* most important thing you should be doing, right up there with studying for the SAT/ACT (which you should've definitely heard of by now). Knowing what schools you'll be applying to will make this entire process smoother, because then you'll be able to organize your work around the deadlines for each (and believe me, they all have different ones for every little thing). Make a list of about 10-15 that you want to go to, and make sure you *want* to go there: in some cases, there's no backing out [^1]. Once that's done, you can start on working towards your second goal, the *personal essay*.

## Spilling the beans (or tea, or hot goss, or...)
The next most important thing is to start working on your *personal essay*. See, most colleges[^2] use an application platform called [CommonApp](https://www.commonapp.org/), which requires a personal essay. This essay is then used by most[^3] colleges

[^1]: Early Decision is *binding* for most (if not all) schools.
[^2]: See: [MIT's application](https://apply.mitadmissions.org/apply), the [UC Colleges Application](https://apply.universityofcalifornia.edu), et cetera.
[^3]: Again, see [MIT's essay questions](https://mitadmissions.org/apply/firstyear/essays-activities-academics/), the [UC Colleges Personal Insight questions](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/how-to-apply/applying-as-a-freshman/personal-insight-questions.html), et cetera. For some reason, the University of Washington doesn't require an essay in the Writing section of the C.
