import Counter from "./Counter.svelte";
import CounterDisplay from "./CounterDisplay.svelte";

Hi! This is my testing page. What does that mean? well, it means this is where all my website features are tested.

## Post format

At the top, you should see something like “Hello World! Created/Posted on \{date\}”.

## Code block styling

Below, you should see a code block of typescript, colored in correctly.

```ts
let x: string = "hello world!";
const test = () => {
	console.log(x);
};

test();
```

## Math and $\LaTeX$

Below, you should see some $\LaTeX$ being formatted correctly and displayed correctly as math equations. You should be seeing the _Riemann Zeta function_, $\zeta(s)$, as well as its definition!

$$
\displaystyle \zeta (s)=\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{n^{s}}}={\frac {1}{1^{s}}}+{\frac {1}{2^{s}}}+{\frac {1}{3^{s}}}+\cdots
$$

(p.s.: Did you know that this $\LaTeX$ is rendered with [$\KaTeX$](https://katex.org/)? pretty cool, right?)

## Dynamic content with MDX

This blog also supports _dynamic content_ through [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), which means that you can interact with stuff on this page!

Below, click the button to update the counter.

<div class="text-center">
	<Counter client:idle />
</div>

Note that we can _share state_ between components using stores, like [nanostores](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores), or by using plain Svelte stores.

(However, nanostores are more compatible with other frameworks.)

<div class="text-center">
	<CounterDisplay client:idle />
</div>

:point_up: This is a component sharing state through a nanostore!
