Hi! This is my testing page. What does that mean? well, it means this is where all my website features are tested.

## Post format

At the top, you should see something like “Hello World! Created/Posted on \{date\}”.

## Code block styling

Below, you should see a code block of typescript, colored in correctly.

```ts
let x: string = "hello world!";
const test = () => {
	console.log(x);
};

test();
```

## Math and $\LaTeX$

Below, you should see some $\LaTeX$ being formatted correctly and displayed correctly as math equations. You should be seeing the _Riemann Zeta function_, $\zeta(s)$, as well as its definition!

$$
\displaystyle \zeta (s)=\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{n^{s}}}={\frac {1}{1^{s}}}+{\frac {1}{2^{s}}}+{\frac {1}{3^{s}}}+\cdots
$$

(p.s.: Did you know that this $\LaTeX$ is rendered with [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/)? pretty cool, right?)

Here's some more math, using the $\LaTeX$ [physics package](https://ctan.org/pkg/physics?lang=en). Specifically, these are four new calculus theorems you learn in Calculus III:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	\int_a^b\grad f\cdot\dd{\vec r} &= f(\vec{r}(b))-f(\vec{r}(a))\\
	\oint_C \vec F\cdot\dd{\vec r} &= \iint_R\pdv{Q}{x}-\pdv{P}{y}\,\dd A\\
	\oint_C\vec F\cdot\dd{\vec r} &= \iint_S\curl\vec F\cdot\dd{\vec S}\\
	\iint_S\vec F\cdot\dd{\vec S} &= \iiint_E\div\vec F\,\dd V
\end{aligned}
$$

## Dynamic content with MDX

This blog also supports _dynamic content_ through [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), which means that you can interact with stuff on this page!

Below, click the button to update the counter.

<div class="text-center">
	<Counter client:idle />
</div>

This counter stores your clicks in `localStorage`, so they persist on page reloads!

<div class="text-center">
	<PersistentCounter client:idle />
</div>

Note that we can _share state_ between components using stores, like [nanostores](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores), or by using plain Svelte stores.

(However, nanostores are more compatible with other frameworks.)

<div class="text-center">
	<CounterDisplay client:idle />
</div>

:point_up: This is a component sharing state through a nanostore!

## Bibliographies

I made my own plugin to support bibliographies in my blog posts! It uses `remark-directive` to parse the directives, and `citation-js` to parse the citations.

Here's an in-text citation :cite[knuth:1984] wow!

Another one! :cite[lesk:1977]
