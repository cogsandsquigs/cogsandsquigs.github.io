You may notice that throughout my writings, I kinda write a bit sloppily/lazily/weirdly. This is intentional. This is because I am me, someone who is lazy, and doesn't care too much about how I write so long as I get what I was trying to say out there.

Some people may take this as me being sloppy. Tbh, I am, but let me riddle you this: Who the fuck do you think I am? Do you really think I'm churning out posts here for the New York Times?? I'm just some person on the [interblag/blagotubes/blogosphere](https://xkcd.com/181/) trying to make my mark, and I'm not too concerned with how 'neat' my writing has to be. If _you_ can understand me, and _I_ can understand me, then _we_ are both fine.

Sure, if this was a school/work assignment, then yeah, I'd probably write neater. But that's because the parameters are different. The requirements for the writing isn't just "do whatever you want and get it out there" (which is the basis for this (and others) _personal_ website). Its "get it out there, in a nice, neat format which shows you're responsible" or something like that. And I don't really care about niceties and neatness if it's _my_ website. You're crawling onto my domain here, so you suffer with the consequences ;).

And anyways, while I may write for a larger audience, this blog is also just here to hold my personal ideas, and my own special little ramblings about how weird life can be. It's not really for you (although if you find it helpful/interesting/cool, that's perfectly awesome), so take everything I do here with a grain of salt. After all, this is where I lose _my_ marbles, and I don't want you losing yours :p.
