Oh look. CPS made another horrible decision. Yayyyyy (/s).

If you didn't know, CPS has its very own [SOPPA policy](https://www.cps.edu/about/policies/student-online-personal-protection-act/), which many have said is [just](https://www.ilfps.org/orgs_call_on_cps_to_revise_soppa_policy) [awful](https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2021/11/1/22749383/cps-soppa-student-online-personal-protection-act-students-data-privacy-public-schools-adobe). In short, instead of applying reasonable privacy restrictions, it instead restricts technology so much that teachers [can't even use the tools they used to anymore](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-chicago-public-schools-student-privacy-personal-information-20220817-trkwbhehfzeq3imkfzxmhgwhdm-story.html). Recently, however, this impacted _me_.

See, I use [Notion](https://notion.so) to take notes, make flashcards, and organize my life in general. However, CPS decided that, in fact, Notion shouldn't be allowed in schools, and chrome-policy-banned it on school Chromebooks. Why? Because SOPPA, of course!

This angers me so so so much. Notion is so extraordinarily useful to me for note-taking, flashcards, scheduling and numerous other things. Yet, just because it doesn't meet CPS' off-kilter standards, I now can't use it on my school Chromebook?

Not only is CPS banning other, random yet useful utilities, but they are _still allowing other utilities that aren't fully approved according to SOPPA legislation!_

For example, [ASPEN](https://aspen.cps.edu/aspen/logon.do) is still allowed, even though they don't have a vendor contract on file! This is a clear violation of SOPPA, yet CPS doesn't even bat an eye. Ditto with Google products, [Naviance](https://www.naviance.com/), and [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/). Yet Notion isn't allowed? Is it because not as many people use it? Or just because CPS doesn't like it? If I were to guess, it'd be a mix of both, probably.

Anyways, my rant is done here. I'm pissed, and CPS (probably) won't budge.

Fuck.
