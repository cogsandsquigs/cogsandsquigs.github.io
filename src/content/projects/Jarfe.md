This was just a silly side-project to make a [JSFuck](https://jsfuck.com/) compiler, in Rust of course! I just wanted something to do, so why not this?

It was fun making this, and while it serves no practical purpose, it was at least a nice distraction from boredom. Maybe you'll find it useful? (I doubt it)
