title: Flying high

Flying high, I see the skies that cradle the ground below, with its shifting hues casting an iridescent delight to those below and above. Clouds roll by, forming an unbeknownst land of night-dark ocean and puffy-white land. Shifting and changing, it renews itself, creating worlds in the air that only exist for a moment.

I wonder if these worlds have people. Would they be perturbed by their ever-changing domain? Would they have adapted, becoming one with their kingdom in the sky? Endless questions drift by, entertaining thoughts and ideas for a while.

Passing through the clouds, I see a grid of lit houses, their lights flickering as endless minuscule shapes flash by. Almost like it's living, the light moves and waves and dances in the night, a sight to behold from above. Scurrying like ants, vehicles cast their presence across the roads, twisting and turning into their homes for tonight.

The last thing I see before landing is the vestiges of the sky and land connected on the horizon, with the shadows of the land standing prominently in-between, an inescapable presence.
